    <p>Quality sleep is fundamental to good health, both physically and mentally. Sleep hygiene refers to practices and habits that promote a restful and rejuvenating sleep. This includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, limiting screen time before bedtime, and avoiding stimulants like caffeine close to bedtime. Prioritizing sleep hygiene enhances the quality of sleep, improves cognitive function, and supports overall mental and emotional resilience. Developing healthy sleep habits is an integral aspect of self-care and contributes to a more balanced and energized life.</p>
